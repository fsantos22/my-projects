- Pokemons can be captured and viewed on the pokedex;
- When capturing a PokÃ©mon it is removed from the rendered list. Upon releasing it, it returns to the list;
- On the details page it is possible to see the infos of the selected pokemon, also having the option to capture or release it;
- Within Pokedex you can choose 'Battle' where two Pokedex PokÃ©mon will be compared and the likely winner will be said;
